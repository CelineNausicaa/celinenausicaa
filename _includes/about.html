                Hi there! <br />
                My name is CÃ©line and I am a recent graduate in Natural Language Processing. I am a language lover, and by that, I mean <em>any</em> kind of languages - may they be programming or natural languages.

                Additionally, I also love teaching - even more so if it is teaching programming languages.
                This portfolio will give you a quick overview of my projects, research and experience. If you would like to chat about any of these, do no hesitate to reach out!
