                Hi there! <br />
                My name is CÃ©line and I am a recent graduate in Natural Language Processing. I am a language lover, and by that, I mean <em>any</em> kind of languages - may they be programming or natural languages.

                Apart from programming, I also really enjoy teaching. I have 3+ years of experience in teaching to various age groups and in a wide range of topics (ranging from STEM to languages). This portfolio will give you an overview of my research and experience.
